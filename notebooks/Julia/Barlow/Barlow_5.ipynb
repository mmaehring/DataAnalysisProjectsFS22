    "\n",
    "In the field of statistics, the term 'estimation' takes on a distinctly different meaning than in everyday life. In this context, it means a precise and accurate procedure, leading to a result which may be imprecise, but where at least <i>the extent of the imprecision is known</i>. It is __not__ an approximation. \n",

    "They are employed when we have some data, from which we want to draw conclusions and produce a \"best\" value. for some particular quantity (or several quantities) and we want to know how reliable this number is (its error). \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "###### Definition\n",
    "__An estimator__ <i>is a procedure applied to the data sample which gives a numerical value for a property of the parent distribution or, as appropriate, a property or parameter of the parent distribution function</i>"
